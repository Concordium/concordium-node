extra-deps:
  # lts-23.27 uses Cabal-3.10.3.0, which includes a fix (https://github.com/haskell/cabal/pull/9554)
  # that unfortunately breaks linking on Windows by adding -rpath linker flags. It appears this
  # is fixed as of Cabal-3.12.1.0 (and maybe 3.12.0.0), and this seems to be compatible with our
  # other dependencies, so we use it. Once we update to an lts that uses a new enough version of
  # Cabal, we should remove this dependency (which shadows the one from the snapshot).
