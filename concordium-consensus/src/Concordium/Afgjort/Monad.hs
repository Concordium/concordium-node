    -- * `ResultUnverifiable`: the message could not be verified because it pertains to a future round.
    -- * `ResultDuplicate`: the message was received before.
    -- * `ResultPendingFinalization`: the message is for a future round, but we're not throwing it away.
    -- * `ResultInvalid`: the message is not valid.
    -- * `ResultSuccess`: the message was received and not found invalid.
    -- * `ResultIncorrectFinalizationSession`: the finalization session of the message is not what is expected.

    -- If the record is for a finalization index that is settled (i.e. the finalization
    -- record appears in a finalized block) then this returns 'ResultStale'.
    --
    -- If the record is for a finalization index where a valid finalization record is already
    -- known, then one of the following applies:
    --
    --   * If the record is invalid, returns 'ResultInvalid'.
    --   * If the record is valid and contains new signatures, stores the record and returns 'ResultSuccess'.
    --   * If @validateDuplicate@ is not set or the record is valid, returns 'ResultDuplicate'.

    -- When more than one case could apply, it is unspecified which is chosen. It is intended that
    -- 'ResultSuccess' should be used wherever possible, but 'ResultDuplicate' can be returned in any
    -- case.
    --
    -- If the record is for the next finalization index:
    --
    --   * If the record is valid and for a known block, that block is finalized and 'ResultSuccess' returned.
    --   * If the record is invalid, 'ResultInvalid' is returned.
    --   * If the block is unknown, then 'ResultUnverifiable' is returned.
    --
    -- If the record is for a future finalization index (that is not next), 'ResultUnverifiable' is returned
    -- and the record is discarded.
