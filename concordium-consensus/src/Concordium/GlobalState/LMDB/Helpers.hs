    Chief among them is the 'MDBDatabase' class, which can be used for

    The 'Cursor' type and the 'withCursor' and 'getCursor' operations
    provide a type-safe abstraction over cursors.

-- |A reader-writer lock that strongly prefer writers. More precisely this means the following
-- - readers and writers are mutually exclusive
-- - multiple readers may hold the lock at the same time if there is no writer
-- - at most one writer may hold the lock
--
-- If a writer tries to acquire a lock it will either
-- - succeed if there are no current readers or writers
-- - block after recording the intent to lock. While there are pending writers no new readers can acquire the lock.
--
-- If multiple writers are blocking on the lock they will be served in an
-- unspecified order and in principle it is possible that with heavy write
-- contention some writers would be starved. This is not the case for the
-- use-case we have.
--
-- Let ⊤ mean that the MVar is full and ⊥ that it is empty. The fields of the lock satisfy the following
-- properties.
-- - there are exactly waitingWriters threads blocking on acquireWrite
-- - rwlState == Free if and only if rwlReadLock == ⊤ and rwlWriteLock == ⊤
-- - rwlReadLock == ⊥ if and only if there is an active reader.
-- - rwlWriteLock == ⊥ if and only if there is an active writer.
--
-- Transitions between states are governed by the following transition system
-- where AW/RW and AR/RR mean acquire write, release write and acquire read,
-- release read, respectively. The WR and WW mean that the thread that
-- executed the transition is blocked waiting for rwlReadLock and rwlWriteLock MVar to be full.
