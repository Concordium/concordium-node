type TransactionHashTable = HM.HashMap TransactionHash (BlockItem, LiveTransactionStatus)

-- | Purge transactions that are not present in any live or finalized blocks
--  and either have expired or were received before the oldest permitted arrival
--  time.
--
--   1. Traverse the account non-finalized transaction table. For each account:
--
--      a) Iterate over the nonces.  For each transaction, check
--         if it can be purged, removing it from the set and the transaction table
--         if so.  If the set at a nonce ends up empty, remove the entry in the
--         non-finalized transaction table.
--
--      b) Determine the maximal non-empty nonce.  If there is an entry in the
--         pending transaction table for the account, update it by either
--         removing the entry (if the new max nonce is lower than the old low value)
--         or updating the high nonce to the new max nonce (otherwise).
--
--   2. For each credential deployment in the pending transaction table, if it can
--      be purged, remove it from the set and the transaction table.
--
--  A transaction is eligible for purging only if it does not belong to any
--  current blocks. This is considered to be the case if the corresponding
--  entry in the transaction table is a `Received` or `Committed` and the
--  `_tsCommitPoint` field is less than or equal to the slot of the last finalized block.
--
--  Transactions are only purged if they have expired (so they would not be valid
--  in any block created from now on) or if they arrived sufficiently long ago
--  (where sufficiently long ago should be determined by subtracting the keep-alive
--  time from the current time).
