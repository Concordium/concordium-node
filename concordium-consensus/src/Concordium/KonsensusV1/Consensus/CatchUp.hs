-- notes

-- We need to catch up blocks,
-- quorum certificates/messages and timeout certificates/messages
--
-- In particular if receiving a quorum/timeout message triggers catch up then
-- these messages will need to be part of the catch up.
--
-- (In an aggregated fashion qcs, tcs, qms, tms)
--
-- Catchup responses must bypass the deduplication layer,
-- hence if we are catching up from a peer then their responses should
-- not be deduplicated.

{-
A node N is up to date with a peer P if:
    * N considers P's last finalized block to be finalized.
    * The round of N's highest certified block is at least the round of P's highest certified block.
    * N's current round (round(N)) is at least P's current round.
    * N's current epoch is at least P's current epoch.
    * N has all timeout signatures on round(N) that P has, and considers them valid if they are.
    * N has all quorum signatures on round(N) that P has, and considers them valid if they are.
    * If P has only one block in round(N), then N also has that block.

If P is honest and considers a timeout signature on round(N) valid, then

-- |The 'CatchUpTerminalData' is sent as part of a catch-up response that concludes catch-up with
-- the peer (i.e. the peer has sent all relevant information).
--
-- If the peer is not otherwise aware of them, 'cutdQuorumCertificates' should include QCs on:
--    * The block in the round after the last finalized block (if the peer does not consider it
--      finalized already).
--    * The highest certified block (if for a later round than the peer's highest certified block).
