-- | This module implements the catch-up mechanism for consensus version 1.
--
--  The catch-up mechanism defines three types of catch-up messages, represented by 'CatchUpMessage':
--     * A catch-up status message ('CatchUpStatusMessage') is used to inform a peer that this node
--       may have relevant data that it has not sent to the peer. The message includes a summary of
--       the node's state allowing the peer to determine if catch-up is necessary.
--     * A catch-up request message ('CatchUpRequestMessage') is used to request catch-up from a
--       peer. The message also includes a summary of the node's state (but with a bit more detail
--       on the branches of the block tree than for the status message), which is used by the peer
--       to determine what data should be sent in order to update the node. The peer should respond
--       by sending a number of blocks (possibly 0, if no catch-up is required) followed by a
--       catch-up response message.
--     * A catch-up response message ('CatchUpResponseMessage') is used to signal the end of a
--       response to a catch-up request. This should be sent after any blocks that are sent to the
--       peer as part of the catch-up. If all relevant blocks were sent, the response also includes
--       terminal data ('CatchUpTerminalData') that may include quorum certificates, timeout
--       certificates, quorum messages and timeout messages that are responsive to the catch-up
--       request.
--
--  The catch-up mechanism first catches up nodes with the finalized chain, followed by the
--  non-finalized blocks ordered by height. QCs for the highest certified block and (if different)
--  the certified block that causes the last finalized block to be finalized are included in the
--  terminal data. If the last round timed-out, then a TC for that round is also included.
--  Finally, quorum and timeout messages for the current round that the peer does not already have
--  are also included in the terminal data.

-- | 'CatchUpPartialResponse' represents a stream of blocks to send as a response to a catch-up
--  request. The catch up response message should include the catch-up terminal data if all required
--  blocks are sent. As the stream of blocks may be cut off early (e.g. to send max 100 blocks),
--  if the last result is 'CatchUpPartialResponseBlock' then 'cuprFinish' should be called to
--  determine if the terminal data should be included.

-- | Determine if we should catch-up with a peer based on the catch-up status message we have

--  finalized round, since in that case it does not have anything useful for us. Otherwise, we
--  should catch up if any of the following hold:
--
--    * Any of the peer's leaf blocks is pending or unknown. (These blocks could trigger spurious
--      catch-up if they are behind our last finalized block. However, we assume that the peer
--      will mutually catch-up with us, at which point it will no longer report those blocks in
--      its leaves.)

--    * The peer's current round is the same as ours, and we are missing any of its quorum
--      messages.
--
--    * The peer's current round is the same as ours, and we are missing any of its timeout messages,
--      except where the timeout messages are for an irrelevant epoch.
--
--  As noted above, it can be the case that catch-up is triggered even when it is not necessary.
--  However, catch-up should always be triggered when it is necessary.

--  1. Process the quorum certificate for the highest certified block, if present. This may
--     result in updating the highest certified block advancing the round. When we advance the
--     round, we do not immediately call 'makeBlock', which is called later.
--
--  2. Process the finalization entry, if present. This may result in updating the last finalized
--     block, and could advance to a new epoch.
--
--  3. Process the timeout certificate, if present. If the timeout certificate is relevant, it may
--     advance the round. As above, when we advance the round, we do not immediately call
--     'makeBlock'.
--
--  4. Process the quorum messages. This may cause a QC to be generated and advance the round.
--     In that case, 'makeBlock' is immediately called as part of the processing.
--
--  5. Process the timeout messages. This may cause a TC to be generated and advance the round.
--     In that case, 'makeBlock' is immediately called as part of the processing.
--
--  6. Call 'makeBlock'. This will do nothing if the baker has already baked a block for the round,
--     so it is fine to call even if it was already called.
--
--  Note that processing the QCs and TC can both cause the round to advance. We defer calling
--  'makeBlock' because if the node produces a block for a round that already has a TC, then it
--  will never get a QC, and so the effort would be wasted.
--
--  If any of the data is invalid or would trigger a catch-up, this returns
--  'TerminalDataResultInvalid'. If the data is fine (in as much as we inspect it), this returns
--  'TerminalDataResultValid'. In either case, 'tdrProgress' indicates if processing the data
--  results in an update to the consensus state. If there is progress, then we may have information
--  that is useful to peers, and thus should (queue) sending catch-up status messages to peers.
