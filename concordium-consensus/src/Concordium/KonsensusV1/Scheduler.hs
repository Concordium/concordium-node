-- * Block prologue

-- | Update the state to reflect an epoch transition.  If the block is not the first in a new epoch
--  then this does nothing.  Otherwise, it makes the following changes:
--
--   * If the new epoch is the first block of a new payday:
--
--       - Captures the 'PaydayParameters' from the state, which are returned.
--
--       - Rotates the capital distribution and epoch bakers so that the values snapshotted at the
--         start of the previous epoch become the current values.
--
--       - Updates the time and mint rate for the next payday, based on the current chain parameters.
--
--       - Process pending cooldowns on bakers and delegators that were set to elapse by the
--         trigger block time for the previous epoch.
--
--   * The seed state is updated to reflect the epoch transition.
--
--   * If the new epoch is the epoch before the next payday, take a snapshot of bakers and
--     delegators, allowing for cooldowns that are set to elapse at by the trigger block time for
--     this epoch.
--
--  Note: If the baker or delegator cooldown period is ever less than the duration of an epoch, then
--  it would be possible to have a baker not in cooldown when the baker snapshot is taken, but be
--  removed when the cooldowns are processed at the payday. This is bad, because the baker/delegator
--  would not have their stake locked while they are baking/delegating. However, this should not be
--  a catastrophic invariant violation.

-- | Construct a block, computing the new block state. This draws transactions from the transaction
--  table (that are pending according to the pending transaction table) and executes them, selecting
--  only valid transactions for inclusion.  The runtime parameters limit the block size and time to
--  spend on constructing the block.  This returns a 'FilteredTransactions' that indicates which
--  transactions were included in the block, as well as any that were found to be invalid. It also
--  returns the new block state and the energy used by the transactions.

--  Note that this does not update the transaction table.
