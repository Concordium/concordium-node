-- |'MonadTreeStateStore' defines the interface to the low-level tree state database.
-- An implementation should guarantee atomicity, consistency and isolation for these operations.
-- Durability is also expected from a persistent implementation.
-- The write operations in particular may involve updating multiple tables and should guarantee
-- transactional behaviour.
--
-- The following invariants apply:
--     * Every block in the store is either finalized or certified.
--     * The genesis block is always finalized and has height 0.
--     * No other genesis blocks are stored in the database.
--     * The latest finalization entry is always present if there is more than one finalized block.
--     * If present, the latest finalization entry finalizes the last finalized block.
--     * The transactions indexed in the store are exactly the transactions of finalized blocks.

    -- |Record a finalization entry that finalizes a list of blocks, and mark the blocks and their
    -- transactions as finalized.
    -- This has the following effects:
    --
    -- 1. The QCs for all rounds up to and including the round of the new last finalized block
    --    are removed.
    -- 2. Each block where the QC was removed is also removed from the block table, unless it is in
    --    the list of newly-finalized blocks.
    -- 3. Each newly-finalized block that didn't have a QC is written to the block table.
    -- 4. The finalization entry is updated to be the new finalization entry.
    -- 5. Each newly-finalized block is added to the finalized blocks by height index.
    -- 6. The transactions in the newly-finalized blocks are added to the finalized transactions.
    --
    -- The following preconditions are required to ensure the database invariants are maintained:
    --
    --   * The list of blocks is non-empty, consists of consecutive non-finalized blocks
    --     that form a chain.
