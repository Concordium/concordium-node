-- This function ensures that the resulting list is no longer than the given limit.

-- This function ensures that the lists of finalization records and block pointers are merged
-- respecting the following properties.
--
--   * A finalization record is sent as sson as possible after the corresponding block it finalizes.
--   * If a block does not need to be sent (because the peer already has it), but a finalization record does,
--     then we send the finalization record before all other blocks.
