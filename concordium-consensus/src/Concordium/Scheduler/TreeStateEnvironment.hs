-- |Mint new tokens and distribute rewards to bakers, finalizers and the foundation.
-- The process consists of the following four steps:
--
-- 1. If the block is the first in a new epoch, distribute the baking reward account
--    to the bakers of the previous epoch in proportion to the number of blocks they
--    baked. (The reward per block is BakingRewardAccount/#blocks, rounded down.
--    Any remainder is kept in the account.)
--
-- 2. GTU is minted for each slot since the previous block.  The minted GTUs are
--    distributed to the baker reward account, finalization reward account, and
--    foundation account. (Rounding favours the foundation account.  GTU is minted
--    for a series of slots before it is divided among the recipients, which should
--    reduce the effect of rounding.  The series of slots is typically the entire
--    number between blocks, but is broken for updates to the mint rate and distribution
--    fractions.)
--
-- 3. If the block contains a finalization record, the finalizers are rewarded with
--    the balance of the finalization reward account, distributed according to their
--    voting power (i.e. their stake).  The reward to each finalizer is rounded down,
--    with any remaining balance remaining in the reward account.  (Note: the rounding
--    here is different to the baking reward distribution.)
--
-- 4. The transaction fees are distributed between the baker, GAS account, and foundation
--    account.  Additionally, a fraction of the old GAS account is paid to the baker,
--    including incentives for including the 'free' transaction types.  (Rounding of
--    the fee distribution favours the foundation.  The GAS reward is rounded down.)
