--
-- * Takes a 'ResourceMeasure' to which the remaining energy should be converted.
-- * Should return __how much of the 'ResourceMeasure' was used__ (which is then converted
--   back to 'Energy'), or 'Nothing' to signal failure because of running out of the 'ResourceMeasure'.
-- * Should satisfy that the returned energy is <= given energy, even though
--   this is not necessary for the correctness of this function. In the case
--   where the returned energy exceeds remaining energy this function will
--   return either with 'OutOfEnergy' or 'outOfBlockEnergy'.
