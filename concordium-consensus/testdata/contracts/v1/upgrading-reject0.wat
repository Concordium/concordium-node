;; Contains a contract with an entrypoint 'upgrade', which triggers an upgrade to 'upgrading-reject0.wasm' (module reference is provided as the parameter).
;; The entrypoint then rejects the update which should cause the upgrade to rollback.
;; This is tested by calling the `new_feature` entrypoint, which only exists in the upgraded module.
