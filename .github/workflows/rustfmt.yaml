# Workflow triggered by pushes to the master branch and PRs targeting it
# (as long as the commits contain Rust code changes).

# The workflow consists of the single job 'rustfmt'
# which checks formatting of the Rust sources using the 'rustfmt' tool.
# The job is skipped if the workflow was triggered by a PR
# marked as a draft.
