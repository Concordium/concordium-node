indentation: 4 # How many spaces to use as an indent.
column-limit: none # We do not set a limit as it may break idempotence.
function-arrows: trailing # Where to place arrows in type signatures.
comma-style: trailing # Where to place commas in lists, tuples, etc.
import-export-style: diff-friendly # How to format multiline import/export lists (diff-friendly lists have trailing commas but keep the opening parenthesis on the same line as import).
indent-wheres: false # 'false' means save space by only half-indenting the 'where' keyword.
record-brace-space: false # rec {x = 1} vs. rec{x = 1}.
newlines-between-decls: 1 # number of newlines between top-level declarations.
haddock-style: single-line # Use -- |, {- |, or {-| for multiline haddocks (single-line haddocks always use --).
let-style: auto # How to style let blocks (auto uses newline if there's a newline in the input and inline otherwise, and mixed uses inline only when the let has exactly one binding).
in-style: left-align # How to align the in keyword with respect to let.
single-constraint-parens: always # Whether to put parentheses round a single constraint
unicode: never
respectful: true # Be less aggressive in reformatting input, e.g. keep empty lines in import list.

 # This operator is defined in Concordium.Utils. Fourmolu seems to ignore its fixity specification.

 # Fourmolu incorrectly determines the fixity of operators re-exported in Lens.Micro.Platform.
 # We make explicit those that are in Lens.Micro.Mtl, since it does not seem sufficient to
