# - build_env_name (e.g., Testnet)
# - build_env_name_lower (e.g., testnet)
# - build_genesis_hash
# - build_collector_backend_url (e.g. https://dashboard.testnet.concordium.com/nodes/post)

# - build_listen_port (e.g., 8889)
# - build_bootstrap (e.g., bootstrap.testnet.concordium.com:8888)

# Figure out the package version. We run the concordium-node binary and
